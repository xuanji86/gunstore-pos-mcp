"""Set-level fact: NO tool on this server can write GunBroker Settings'
environment, credential or money fields.

This file exists because the r1 fix was correct and still wrong. The guard was
attached to `update_settings`, one tool out of the whole write face, and
`frappe_update_document` walked straight past it with sandbox_mode. Every test
written at the time asserted the guard function, or that one tool — none asked
"can this doctype still be written from anywhere on this server", which is the
only question whose answer anyone actually cares about.

So the assertions here are deliberately about the SURFACE, not about a function:

* `EveryWritePath` — drive each generic write tool with a forbidden payload and
  require a refusal, with a client that trips if anything reaches the wire.
* `NoNewToolCanForget` — a static check over every registered tool: anything
  that can write a document body must call check_fields_writable. This is the
  part that catches the NEXT tool, which is how the last gap got in.
