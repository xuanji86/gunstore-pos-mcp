"""Centralized write guards used by every mutating tool.

Concerns kept in one place so generic and curated tools can't diverge:
  - strip_passwords: credentials never transit the MCP / the conversation.
  - require_confirm: destructive/consequential ops need an explicit confirm=true.
  - check_write_allowed: structural/permission doctypes are read-only here.
  - check_fields_writable: some fields are not writable through the MCP at all.
  - check_method_call_writable: the same rule, for the run_method escape hatch.

# Name-based credential backstop — applied to EVERY key at every nesting level,
# even when doctype meta can't be fetched, so a secret can't slip through on a
# transient describe failure. Meta-based Password-type detection is primary.
#
# `[_-]key\b` is the general arm: it catches `consumer_key`, `dev_key`,
# `sandbox_dev_key` and anything else spelled <thing>_key, while leaving RSR's
# `key_dealer` / `ftp_dir_keydealer` alone (those are a dealer tier, not a
# secret — "key" leads there, and no word boundary follows it). A bare `key`
# would strip both and break legitimate writes. `dev[_-]?key` is spelled out
# separately so the unseparated `devkey` is covered too, the way `apikey` is.
#
# Verified against every Password field in the platform: before this arm,
# `consumer_key` (WooCommerce Settings AND Dealer WooCommerce Settings) already
# escaped the backstop — GunBroker's DevKey was not the first gap, only the one
# that got noticed.

# Fields the MCP must never write, per doctype. Distinct from the credential

# `sandbox_mode` and set `page_size` in one call believes both landed; strip the
# first and the write half-applies while the response says it succeeded in a
# note nobody reads. For a field that decides whether a firearm goes on the real
# GunBroker, "you may not do this here" has to be an error, not a footnote.
#
# These belong in the desk UI, done by a person who can see the whole settings
# form, not in a tool call an agent can talk itself into. The MCP instance
